                <p>This month's presentation will be on MySQL Database Performance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's face it, when it comes to databases, developers and DBAs don't
  often see eye-to-eye. This talk will help bridge the gap using a common
  goal, "Database Performance".</p>
  
  <p>If you're a developer, you've probably used a query that was performing
  poorly.  Many times the solution is seeking help from a DBA. The DBA
  performs some magic behind a curtain, and all the sudden the query is
  running fast. Wouldn't it be nice to take a peek behind the curtain to
  see the magic being performed? During this talk, we'll discuss several
  aspects of the database that can affect performance. This includes
  schema design, indexes, and queries. We'll also look at some real life
  examples of slow performance and performance solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremy Glick is a MySQL Database Engineer at

a consultant for various technology companies with systems ranging from
dozens to hundreds of database servers. Jeremy is also the organizer of
the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/mysql-5/">Chicago MySQL Meetup</a>. He holds

<p>Due to Joel and Doug being at the <a href="http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2017/">Perl Toolchain
Summit</a>, we have to
cancel the Office Hours this month. We'll have Office Hours again next
month.</p>
