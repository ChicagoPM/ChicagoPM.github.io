title: About Chicago.pm
---

Chicago.pm (sometimes known as WindyCity.pm) is the Chicago chapter of the international [Perl Mongers groups](http://www.pm.org/).

## Meetings

We normally organize two meetings per month.

* Project Night -- the second Thursday of the month. Free-form discussion on any topics of interest. Bring a laptop if you want, bring a project if you have one. Lets have some fun!
* Presentation -- the fourth Thursday of the month. A member or guest will present a talk on some topic. Of course discussion often strays afterwards to other topics of interest.

You are always welcome to bring guests!

Meetings are organized on the [Meetup Group Page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/).

<h2 id="lists">Mailing Lists</h2>

There are two email discussion lists for you to keep in touch with the Chicago Perl community, and to have discussions (not limited to Perl).

* [chicago-announce](http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/chicago-announce) is a list for general chicago.pm announcements. You should subscribe to this list if you want to skip over the majority of the discussion and just get the event announcements.
* [chicago-talk](http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/chicago-talk) is the main list for discussion of all things Perl, Chicago, and anything else you'd like to talk about. List [archives](http://mail.pm.org/pipermail/chicago-talk/) are also available. Note: prior to 29-Aug-2003 chicago-talk was hosted a Topica, you may still be able to view [their archives](http://www.topica.com/lists/chicago-pm/read).

Folks sometimes hang out in #chicago.pm on irc.perl.org. If you have a chance stop by and say "hi".
