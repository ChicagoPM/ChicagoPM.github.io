This month, Dylan Cali from Bank of America will be giving a talk on
[FFI::Raw](https://metacpan.org/pod/FFI::Raw) and his
[ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) Perl binding that uses it:
[ZMQ::FFI](https://metacpan.org/pod/ZMQ::FFI).

FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface, and it is another way to access
native libraries from dynamic languages. FFI::Raw provides an API on to
[libffi](https://sourceware.org/libffi/), allowing you to call native library
functions with pure Perl code!
