This month, brian d foy will be giving a workshop on How to Become a CPAN
Author:

> Have you wanted to upload a Perl module to CPAN but haven't been sure how to
> get started? In this workshop, brian d foy (blog, twitter, github) will lead
> you through the entire process as you upload a real module to CPAN. You'll
> create a new module, upload it to Github, make some changes, and upload it to
> CPAN. You'll break your module, upload the broken distribution, then work with
> others in the class to fix it by sending and merging Github pull requests.
> Finally, you'll upload the fixed module. By the end of the class you'll
> probably see your module on MetaCPAN, automatically announced in various
> places, and you might even get CPAN Testers reports. At every step of the way
> you'll have someone helping, and you'll even add some comaintainers.

The workshop will be held on Thursday, August 14, just in time for [CPAN Day
(August 16th)](http://blogs.perl.org/users/neilb/2014/07/cpan-day---14th-august.html).

[RSVP for Become a CPAN Author on the Chicago.PM Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/196897312/)

With this, we are moving Office Hours to August 28th. Additionally, since
having Office Hours has been more confusing than helpful, we will change our
meeting schedule from "2nd Wednesday and 4th Thursday" to "2nd and 4th
Thursdays".
