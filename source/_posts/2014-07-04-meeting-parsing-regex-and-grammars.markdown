This month, Doug Bell from Bank of America will be giving a talk on Parsing
using plain regular expressions, the venerable
[Parse::RecDescent](https://metacpan.org/pod/Parse::RecDescent), and the modern
[Marpa::R2](https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2).

The examples given will be based on
[App::YAML::Filter](https://metacpan.org/pod/distribution/App-YAML-Filter/bin/yq),
a mini-language like [the jq document query
language](http://stedolan.github.io/jq/) that allows filtering and creating
YAML documents.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/184242172/)
