These are exciting times at [Goldstar Learning](http://goldstarlearning.com).
We've been an innovator and leader in the EdTech space for over 10 years. Our
software has served us well, and we want to take it to the next level. That's
where you and your Dev Team come in. You'll need to keep our current Perl code
base in shape till we get the ball rolling on building the next version of
flagship product. You'll be working side by side with Executive Management,
Product Management and our Professional Development Consultants to build new
features for our loyal client base. You're going to need to have a great team
to get the job done. We have some excellent developers now, but we expect to
hire more and want to attract the best and brightest. To make it easier to do
just that, and accommodate our growth, we will be moving our headquarters to a
new office in downtown Chicago (River North)--near the Merchandise Mart.

As Manager of Software Engineering, you will lead a full stack software
development team in an Agile/Scrum environment. And yes, you'll need to be a
hands-on manager, from coding and code reviews, to managing process, quality,
and project delivery. Our LAMP stack includes Linux, Perl, Ruby, and
PostgreSQL.

The ideal candidate will have an established background building web-based
solutions, offer great communication skills, possess a track record of building
productive development teams, and demonstrate an ability to deliver in a
fast-paced environment. You thrive on tackling difficult problems; have great
troubleshooting abilities and years of hands-on software development skills.
You keep abreast of the latest technology developments and encourage your teams
to think outside the box. You possess strong leadership qualities and a track
record of delivering great solutions.

## Requirements

* Expert level development experience required with an excellent understanding
  of the full software development stack.

  methodologies.

  coding standards, code reviews, source control management, build processes,
  testing, and deployment.
* Strong people management skills and affinity for mentorship.
* Effective problem-solving skills with the ability to support, diagnose and
  resolve issues in a production environment.
* Operate efficiently and effectively with minimal oversight.
* 10+ years software development experience.

consideration.
