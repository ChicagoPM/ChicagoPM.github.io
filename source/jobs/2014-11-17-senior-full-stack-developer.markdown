These are exciting times at [Goldstar Learning](http://goldstarlearning.com).
We've been an innovator and leader in the EdTech space for over 10 years. To
accommodate our rapid growth, we will be moving our headquarters to a new
office in downtown Chicago's Tech Hub (River North)--near the Merchandise Mart.

Our software platform has served us well, and we want to take it to the next
level. That's where you and the rest of the Dev Team come in.

As a Full Stack Engineer, you will be working in an Agile/Scrum environment.
Our LAMP stack includes Linux, Perl, Ruby, and PostgreSQL. You'll work with a
solid team of peers to keep our current code base in shape and build new
features for our loyal client base. While you are at it, help us get the ball
rolling on building the next version of our flagship product. This is your
chance to contribute what you know (A strong knowledge of OO Perl is essential)
and learn how to get things done using whatever technology is optimal.

The ideal candidate will have an established background building web-based
solutions, offer great communication skills, and demonstrate an ability to
deliver in a fast-paced environment. You thrive on tackling difficult problems;
have great troubleshooting abilities and years of hands-on software development
skills. You keep abreast of the latest technology developments and think
outside the box. As a Senior Engineer, you demonstrate strong leadership
characteristics and a track record of delivering great solutions.

## Requirements:

* Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science, Computer Engineering or equivalent.
* Advanced development experience with a solid understanding of the full
  software development stack
* Demonstrated experience with modern object-oriented programming and testing
  methodologies.
* Effective problem-solving skills with the ability to support, diagnose and
  resolve issues in a production environment.
* Familiar with a source code repository, ideally Git and project tracking
  tools like JIRA
* Operate efficiently and effectively with a minimum of oversight.
* 8+ years software development experience.
* 2+ years of senior experience.
    * (We will consider candidates with less experience if you can demonstrate
      your abilities and effective experience.)
* Linux Admin Experience a plus

We offer a competitive salary based on experience along with a comprehensive
benefits package that includes 401K, Health, Dental, Disability and Life
Insurance.

Relocation assistance is an option we would take into consideration.

Only US Citizen or Green Card Holder (No Sponsorship) need apply.
