Jason will go over how Perl helped him build the client, and the modules
and design decisions that went into the project.</p>

                <p>This month, <a href="http://preaction.me/">Doug Bell</a> will be talking about
a CSS feature newly-supported by browsers: <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-css3-flexbox-20120918/">The flexible box
(flexbox)</a>.
Flexboxes makes laying out rows or columns fast and easy. Simple things
become much easier, and even complex layouts become simple and
responsive for a variety of display devices like phones and tablets. If
you haven't learned anything about CSS in the last few years, or if you
know the pain of using CSS floats, come learn about flexbox!</p>

<p><a href="http://preaction.me/">Doug Bell</a> has been developing websites since the
time of table layouts and spacer GIFs (pronounced "jifs"). He's
developed websites professionally for 10 years, and is the organizer of
<a href="http://hashcss.com/">the #css support community</a> on <a href="http://freenode.net/">the Freenode IRC
network</a>.</p>

            <title>MySQL Database Performance For Developers</title>
            <link>http://127.0.0.1:57366/blog/2017/05/05/mysql-database-performance-for-developers/</link>
            <guid>http://127.0.0.1:57366/blog/2017/05/05/mysql-database-performance-for-developers/</guid>
            <description><![CDATA[
                <p>This month's presentation will be on MySQL Database Performance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let's face it, when it comes to databases, developers and DBAs don't
  often see eye-to-eye. This talk will help bridge the gap using a common
  goal, "Database Performance".</p>
  
  <p>If you're a developer, you've probably used a query that was performing
  poorly.  Many times the solution is seeking help from a DBA. The DBA
  performs some magic behind a curtain, and all the sudden the query is
  running fast. Wouldn't it be nice to take a peek behind the curtain to
  see the magic being performed? During this talk, we'll discuss several
  aspects of the database that can affect performance. This includes
  schema design, indexes, and queries. We'll also look at some real life
  examples of slow performance and performance solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jeremy Glick is a MySQL Database Engineer at
<a href="https://www.ziprecruiter.com">ZipRecruiter</a>. Before that, he worked as
a consultant for various technology companies with systems ranging from
dozens to hundreds of database servers. Jeremy is also the organizer of
the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/mysql-5/">Chicago MySQL Meetup</a>. He holds
multiple MySQL certifications and is a RedHat RHCE.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/239773480/">RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup</a></p>

<p>Due to Joel and Doug being at the <a href="http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2017/">Perl Toolchain
Summit</a>, we have to
cancel the Office Hours this month. We'll have Office Hours again next
month.</p>

                <p>This month, <a href="http://wlindley.com">William Lindley</a> (<a href="http://github.com/lindleyw"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a> <a href="http://blog.wlindley.com">blog</a>) will
<a href="https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/238505149/">talk about writing a test harness for modern Perl programs</a>
using <a href="http://metacpan.org/pod/Test::More">Test::More</a>,
<a href="http://mojolicious.org/perldoc/Test/Mojo">Test::Mojo</a> for the API, and
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::TempDB">DBIx::TempDB</a> for the
database.</p>

<p>Building, testing, and deploying actual systems is more complex than
merely writing a program. Real testing often needs to be done against
databases of known large or problematic datasets. A test environment
cannot affect production data. Staging even minor changes, so we can
preview and find errors before moving to production servers, can prevent
expensive errors. The "best practices" in this field are relatively new
and still changing, and we look at the first steps from "I built this
mockup last night" by building the test suite for a simple
database-driven file-upload service with
<a href="http://mojolicious.org">Mojolicious</a>.</p>

<p>William Lindley has been hacking computers (in the good sense) since
1977, a database advocate since dBase II and PostgreSQL-predecessor
Ingres in the 1980s, a Perl monger since 1994, and a free-software
promoter since first getting Linux to run XWindows in 1995.</p>

<p>If time permits, <a href="http://preaction.me">Doug Bell (preaction)</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/preaction"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://github.com/preaction"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>) will
show a simple app to mock JSON REST APIs for testing using Mojolicious.</p>

                <p>This month, we have a special meeting:

talk about Perl 6 Grammars on Thursday, February
16</a>. <a href="https://docs.perl6.org/language/grammars">Grammars in
Perl 6</a> are the evolved form

talk about Perl 6 Grammars on the Chicago.PM

<p>For our regular meeting, <a href="http://preaction.me">Doug Bell (preaction)</a> (<a href="http://twitter.com/preaction"><i class="fa fa-twitter"></i></a><a href="https://github.com/preaction"><i class="fa fa-github"></i></a>) will
be giving <a href="https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/237417941/">a talk about Logging for Programs Tiny and
Large</a>. It will
cover various ways to add logging and reporting to your Perl programs,
including built-ins like
<a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/warn.html"><code>warn</code></a>, core modules like
<a href="https://metacpan.org/pod/Sys::Syslog"><code>Sys::Syslog</code></a>, and CPAN modules

talk about Logging in Perl 5 on the Chicago.PM
Meetup</a>.</p>

<p>We also need speakers for March and further on the rest of the year. If
you're interested in talking for 20 minutes or 40 minutes about any
topic at least tangentially related to developing software with Perl,

                <p>This month, <a href="http://www.noelrappin.com">Noel Rappin</a> will be talking
about accepting payments on the web:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Your customers have money, and youâd like them to give it to you.
  Payment gateways, such as <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>,
  <a href="https://www.braintreepayments.com">Braintree</a>, and
  <a href="https://paypal.com">Paypal</a>, make it easy to start charging credit
  cards and get the money flowing. But charging cards is only the
  beginning. You need to worry that your app responds gracefully to
  service failures, since charging a customer for a failed transaction
  is bad. You need to guard against fraud and security breaches. You
  need administrative tools that are flexible but secure.  You want to
  test against external services. And youâll run up against the law.
  Learn from some of my mistakes and build a robust financial
  application.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="http://www.noelrappin.com">Noel Rappin</a> is the Director of Development
at [Table XI]. Noel has authored multiple technical books, including
