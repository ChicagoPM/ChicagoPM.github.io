title: Parsely RPG Client
---
This month, <%= include '../../../../../speakers/cromedome.markdown' =%>
will be showing the work he's done on a Perl web client for the [Parsely
RPG system](http://www.memento-mori.com/parsely/). Parsely games are much like the text adventures of yore.
Jason will go over how Perl helped him build the client, and the modules
and design decisions that went into the project.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/243591009/). Doors open at 6:30pm. Talk starts at 7:00pm.
