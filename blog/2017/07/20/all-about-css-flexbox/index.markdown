title: All About CSS Flexbox
---
This month, [Doug Bell](http://preaction.me/) will be talking about
a CSS feature newly-supported by browsers: [The flexible box
(flexbox)](https://www.w3.org/TR/2012/CR-css3-flexbox-20120918/).
Flexboxes makes laying out rows or columns fast and easy. Simple things
become much easier, and even complex layouts become simple and
responsive for a variety of display devices like phones and tablets. If
you haven't learned anything about CSS in the last few years, or if you
know the pain of using CSS floats, come learn about flexbox!

[Doug Bell](http://preaction.me/) has been developing websites since the
time of table layouts and spacer GIFs (pronounced "jifs"). He's
developed websites professionally for 10 years, and is the organizer of
[the #css support community](http://hashcss.com/) on [the Freenode IRC
network](http://freenode.net/).
