title: MySQL Database Performance For Developers
---

This month's presentation will be on MySQL Database Performance:

> Let's face it, when it comes to databases, developers and DBAs don't
> often see eye-to-eye. This talk will help bridge the gap using a common
> goal, "Database Performance".

> If you're a developer, you've probably used a query that was performing
> poorly.  Many times the solution is seeking help from a DBA. The DBA
> performs some magic behind a curtain, and all the sudden the query is
> running fast. Wouldn't it be nice to take a peek behind the curtain to
> see the magic being performed? During this talk, we'll discuss several
> aspects of the database that can affect performance. This includes
> schema design, indexes, and queries. We'll also look at some real life
> examples of slow performance and performance solutions.

Due to Joel and Doug being at the [Perl Toolchain
Summit](http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2017/), we have to
cancel the Office Hours this month. We'll have Office Hours again next
month.
