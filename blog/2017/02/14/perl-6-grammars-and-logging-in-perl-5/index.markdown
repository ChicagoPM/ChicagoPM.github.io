title: Perl 6 Grammars and Logging in Perl 5
---

This month, we have a special meeting:
[brian d foy](https://www.effectiveperlprogramming.com) ([<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](http://twitter.com/briandfoy_perl)[<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/briandfoy)) will be giving [a
talk about Perl 6 Grammars on Thursday, February
16](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/237694944/). [Grammars in
Perl 6](https://docs.perl6.org/language/grammars) are the evolved form
of Perl 5 regular expressions that allow even more power and
flexibility, while still being easier to use. [RSVP for this special
talk about Perl 6 Grammars on the Chicago.PM
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/237694944/).

For our regular meeting, [Doug Bell (preaction)](http://preaction.me) ([<i class="fa fa-twitter"></i>](http://twitter.com/preaction)[<i class="fa fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/preaction)) will
be giving [a talk about Logging for Programs Tiny and
Large](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/237417941/). It will
cover various ways to add logging and reporting to your Perl programs,
including built-ins like
[`warn`](http://perldoc.perl.org/functions/warn.html), core modules like
[`Sys::Syslog`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Sys::Syslog), and CPAN modules
like [`Log::Any`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Log::Any) and
[`Log::Log4perl`](http://mschilli.github.io/log4perl/). [RSVP for the
talk about Logging in Perl 5 on the Chicago.PM
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/237417941/).

We also need speakers for March and further on the rest of the year. If
you're interested in talking for 20 minutes or 40 minutes about any
topic at least tangentially related to developing software with Perl,

spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13NUmlmW2bTlMHf8-waPKIlF69Cfv6msHnkfu9bAdsFA/edit).
