This month is [The Perl Conference](http://www.perlconference.us/tpc-2017-dc/)
(formerly YAPC). Because of this, we have to move our meeting to June 29th. At
the meeting we'll discuss the talks and announcements from the conference over
food and drinks! [RSVP for the meeting on our Meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/240742773/).

If you haven't already, be sure to join the Chicago Perl Mongers on Slack using
<http://chicagotechslack.com>. We're in the #perl channel, and I'll be talking
about the things I see at the conference.
