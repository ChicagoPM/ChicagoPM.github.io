This month, <%= include '../../../../../speakers/jberger.markdown' %> will
give a talk on Perl variable scoping rules, including the `my`, `our`,
and `local` keywords, how they work, and some interesting ways they can
be used.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup
page](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/236748063)

(EDIT: [Slides for Variables, Scoping, and Namespaces are available on
the talks page](/talks))
