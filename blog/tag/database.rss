                <p>This month&#39;s presentation will be on MySQL Database Performance:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let&#39;s face it, when it comes to databases, developers and DBAs don&#39;t
  often see eye-to-eye. This talk will help bridge the gap using a common
  goal, &quot;Database Performance&quot;.</p>
  
  <p>If you&#39;re a developer, you&#39;ve probably used a query that was performing
  poorly.  Many times the solution is seeking help from a DBA. The DBA
  performs some magic behind a curtain, and all the sudden the query is
  running fast. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice to take a peek behind the curtain to
  see the magic being performed? During this talk, we&#39;ll discuss several
  aspects of the database that can affect performance. This includes
  schema design, indexes, and queries. We&#39;ll also look at some real life
  examples of slow performance and performance solutions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Due to Joel and Doug being at the <a href="http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2017/">Perl Toolchain
Summit</a>, we have to
cancel the Office Hours this month. We&#39;ll have Office Hours again next
month.</p>
