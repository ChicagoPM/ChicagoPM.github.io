This month, we're doing [Lightning Talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk). Lightning talks are 5-10 minute informal (slides-optional) presentations.

The meeting will be this week, May 26. Doors open at 6:30pm, and the meeting starts at 7. [RSVP to attend on the Chicago.PM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/183534582/)

This month, anything goes, so you can talk about whatever you'd like to talk about. If you've got something you'd like to present, [leave a comment on the Chicago.PM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/183534582/).
