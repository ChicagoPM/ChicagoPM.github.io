title: 'Lightning Talks - My Dev Environment'
---

This month, we're doing [lightning talks on the topic of "My Dev Environment"](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/199302682/).
[Lightning talks](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) are 5-10 minute, informal
presentations. Bring your development environment (editor, IDE, operating
system, shell, and otherwise) and tell us
the most useful parts.

This is not strictly a Perl talk, so if you know someone who'd like to hear
some tips, or would like to give some tips, bring them along.

If you'd like to present your dev environment, [leave a comment on the ChicagoPM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/199302682/).

Office Hours will be on Thursday the 11th. [RSVP for Office Hours on the ChicagoPM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/204729852/).
