title: What Happened At The MetaCPAN Hackathon
---

The [MetaCPAN hackathon](https://metacpan.org/about/meta_hack) here in
Chicago has come and gone, and those who participated have written about
what they accomplished. [All the after-hackathon reports are linked on
the meta::hack page](https://metacpan.org/about/meta_hack). From our own
members, [Doug Bell wrote about his meta::hack
accomplishments](http://blogs.perl.org/users/preaction/2016/11/metahack-log.html)
and [Joel Berger also wrote about his meta::hack
accomplishments](http://blogs.perl.org/users/joel_berger/2016/12/metahack-2016.html).
Thanks to [the sponsors who made meta::hack
happen](https://metacpan.org/about/meta_hack).
