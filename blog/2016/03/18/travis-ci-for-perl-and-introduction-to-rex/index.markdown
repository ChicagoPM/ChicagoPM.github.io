title: Travis-CI for Perl and Introduction to Rex
---
This month, [Doug Bell](http://preaction.me) will be giving two short
talks.

One talk is about using [Travis-CI, a free continuous integration
testing service](https://travis-ci.org), for Perl projects, and
maximizing Travis's effectiveness. This talk introduces [Graham
Knop](https://github.com/haarg)'s [Perl Travis
Helpers](https://github.com/travis-perl/helpers), gets you started using
Travis-CI, and shows how to configure Travis to cover edge cases like
very old Perls and missing optional modules/features (using
[Devel::Hide](http://metacpan.org/pod/Devel::Hide)).

The other talk is an introduction to [Rex, a Perl-based server
configuration management system](http://rexify.org). This talk was given
informally at an office hours last year, but now it's a real talk with
real slides! This talk introduces Rex, goes through simple configuration
and tasks, and touches on some of the more powerful features of Rex such
as the CMDB (Configuration Management Database).
