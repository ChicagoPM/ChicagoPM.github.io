title: Collecting Metrics with Graphite
---

This month, [Doug Bell](http://preaction.me) will give a talk on
[Graphite, a scalable time-series
database](http://graphite.readthedocs.org/en/latest). He'll go over
a quick installation and setup, how to add your metrics using Perl, and
how to display your metrics using the [Grafana charting
dashboard](http://grafana.org).

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/227353550/)
