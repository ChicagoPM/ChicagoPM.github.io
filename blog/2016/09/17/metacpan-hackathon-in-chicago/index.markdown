title: MetaCPAN Hackathon in Chicago
---

[Olaf Alders has announced meta::hack, a MetaCPAN hackathon in
Chicago](http://www.olafalders.com/2016/09/17/announcing-metahack/).
[MetaCPAN](http://www.metacpan.org) is the best place to search for CPAN
modules, and includes lots of useful information like documentation,
links to the source repository and bug tracker, and a summary of [CPAN
Testers](http://www.cpantesters.org) results.

Much like the [Perl QA Hackathon](http://act.qa-hackathon.org/qa2016/),
this event will get the core MetaCPAN team together to achieve a few
targeted goals. The biggest current goal is to get the platform upgraded
to ElasticSearch version 2, but other, smaller tasks may come up as
well.

If you can help, [sponsor the meta::hack
hackathon](http://www.olafalders.com/2016/09/17/announcing-metahack/).
Sponsorship will help pay for travel expenses for the team so they can
concentrate on making MetaCPAN better.
