title: Accepting Payments on the Web
---
This month, [Noel Rappin](http://www.noelrappin.com) will be talking
about accepting payments on the web:

> Your customers have money, and you’d like them to give it to you.
> Payment gateways, such as [Stripe](https://stripe.com),
> [Braintree](https://www.braintreepayments.com), and
> [Paypal](https://paypal.com), make it easy to start charging credit
> cards and get the money flowing. But charging cards is only the
> beginning. You need to worry that your app responds gracefully to
> service failures, since charging a customer for a failed transaction
> is bad. You need to guard against fraud and security breaches. You
> need administrative tools that are flexible but secure.  You want to
> test against external services. And you’ll run up against the law.
> Learn from some of my mistakes and build a robust financial
> application.
