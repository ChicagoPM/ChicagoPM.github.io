title: 'Imager - The Perl Image Library'
---

This month, [William Lindley](http://wlindley.com) will be giving a talk
on [Imager, an image manipulation library for
Perl](http://metacpan.org/pod/Imager). Easier to install than
Image::Magick, Imager has grown into a rich set of tools, including some
overlooked features that turn it into a robust solution.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/228490453/)
