title: Perl Development Environment
---

This month, [Jason Crome](https://crome-plated.com) will be giving a talk on Perl development
environment tooling like [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/),
[plenv](https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv), and
[Carton](https://metacpan.org/pod/Carton). These tools help to manage
different Perl versions, different module versions, and help to isolate
your development environments to help make dependency version problems
manageable.

Bring your questions and your own experiences with maintaining a Perl
development environment.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/232972645/)
