title: Logging and Analytics Using Perl and Fluentd
---

This month, [Jason Crome](http://www.cromedome.net) is giving a talk on
using [Fluentd](http://www.fluentd.org) for logging, and Perl for
analytics:

> Logging is one of the most important pieces you’ll have in any
> large-scale software system, and in a massively multiplayer game it’s
> even more critical. Using Ovid’s Veure MMO as an example, I’ll discuss
> what we are logging and why, how we use fluentd to collect information
> at all levels in the game’s stack, and the tools and processes we use
> to analyze that data.
