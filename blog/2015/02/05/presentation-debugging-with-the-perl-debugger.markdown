title: 'Presentation - Debugging with the Perl Debugger'
---

This month, Brian Mielke will be giving a hands-on talk about the built-in Perl Debugger. The debugger allows you to pause execution of your code, run through it step by step, and examine variables and run arbitrary code while paused. The debugger is a great tool to use when dealing with unfamiliar code, and there's always a lot more of that than it appears.
