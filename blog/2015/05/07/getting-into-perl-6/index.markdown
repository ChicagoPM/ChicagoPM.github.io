title: Getting Into Perl 6
---

You may have heard that [Perl 6](http://perl6.org) is making its debut this
Christmas; This is the perfect time to get involved and help the team get
through the last mile. [Rob Hoelz](http://hoelz.ro) will walk through making a
change to [the Rakudo compiler](http://rakudo.org), which will make it easier
to make your own changes and help out! A brief rundown of the evening:

* A quick intro to Perl 6 for newbies
* A brief overview of the Perl 6 ecosystem
* A tour of the Rakudo compiler's source
* Going through the compiler and making the change

Join us on Thursday, May 28 at 7:00 PM. [RSVP on the Chicago.PM
