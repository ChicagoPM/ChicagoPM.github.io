title: The Why Of Git
---

This month [Doug Bell](http://preaction.me) will be giving a talk on
[Git](http://git-scm.com) internals, and how they effect how you use Git
commands like `commit`, `merge`, `pull`, and `rebase`. The presentation
will go over some common errors and explain what they mean, and how
resolving them will affect the internal data of your repository.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM
Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/225737511/)
