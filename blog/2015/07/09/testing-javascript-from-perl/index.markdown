title: Testing Javascript From Perl
---
This month, [Joel Berger](https://metacpan.org/author/JBERGER) will be giving a
talk on testing Javascript from [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us)

> Do you test your Javascript? All of it? Be honest. I thought so, neither did
> I.

> It is very easy to say that testing Javascript is too hard, or that you don't
> need to because you have so little of it. But what if testing your
> client-side Javascript was as easy as testing a Mojolicious app, which is
> pretty darn easy? Would you do it then?

> In this talk I will demonstrate Test::Mojo::Role::Phantom, which allows
> testing a Mojolicious app, PSGI app or even external website's client-side
> Javascript. It only requires the phantomjs executable, which is a piece of
> cake to install. You'll be testing your browser behavior in no time!

Doors open at 6:45. Meeting starts at 7:00. [RSVP on the Meetup
