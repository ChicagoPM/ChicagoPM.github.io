title: Introduction to FFI::Platypus
---

This month, Dylan Cali will give a presentation on [FFI::Platypus, a friendly
and fast interface to libffi](https://metacpan.org/release/FFI-Platypus). With
FFI::Platypus, you can use native libraries without having to write bindings in
XS or one of the Inline modules, and still achieve excellent performance
(almost as fast as XS).

Dylan will also show off other performance improvements added to version 1 of
[ZMQ::FFI](https://metacpan.org/pod/ZMQ::FFI), an FFI-based wrapper for the
[zeromq messaging library](http://zeromq.org).

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/220967211/)
