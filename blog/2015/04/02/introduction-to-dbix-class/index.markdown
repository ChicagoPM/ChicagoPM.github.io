title: Introduction to DBIx::Class
---

This month, Doug Bell will be giving a talk on the
[DBIx::Class](http://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class) ORM library.  DBIx::Class
automates the tedium of writing SQL, and makes it easier to build more portable
and reusable database models.

Examples will be given for an ETL job reporting database with an accompanying
web application.

[RSVP on the Chicago.PM Meetup page](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/220967211/)

(edit: The FFI::Platypus talk will be given another time)

(update: The [slides for the Introduction to DBIx::Class
talk](http://preaction.github.io/Introduction-to-DBIx-Class) are now available
on [the talks page](/talks))
