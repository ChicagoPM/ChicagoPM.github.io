title: Testing PSGI With Test::Mojo and Stupid Websocket Tricks
---

We've got a couple short talks scheduled for this month, and we've got
a new venue, generously provided by [ServerCentral](http://www.servercentral.com).

[Joel Berger](http://metacpan.org/author/JBERGER) is going to give
a talk on testing any [PSGI application](http://plackperl.org) with
[Test::Mojo, Mojolicious's excellent web testing
library.](http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Test/Mojo)

And, [Doug Bell](http://metacpan.org/author/PREACTION) is going to give
a talk on some simple websocket tricks with [Mercury, a WebSocket
message broker](http://metacpan.org/pod/mercury), [Mojolicious](http://mojolicio.us)
and [Mojo::UserAgent](http://mojolicio.us/perldoc/Mojo/UserAgent).

Due to the holidays, our meeting will be on December 10. [RSVP on the
Chicago.PM Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/ChicagoPM/events/226879320/)

(EDIT: Slides from the [simple WebSocket tricks talk are now
